          First project for the RocketAcademy bootcamp. I felt really shaky and
          apart from learning how to create a site structure, tried applying
          some Bootstrap styling to it. I think I'd want to return to the basics
          and learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript properly first, before returning to
          libraries like Bootstrap.

          Second project. This time round, I tried to really build a website
          from scratch with vanilla CSS. I struggled quite a fair bit trying to
          wrap my head around Flexbox, Position, Box Model. From a functional
          perspective, I think I'm slowly getting the hand of how different CSS
          components come together, but there's still much to learn from the
          pros on styling and even code organisation (especially the
          devilishlly-messy <code>.css</code> file)
        </p>
        <div class="contentCard">
          <img src="img/world-clock.png" /><br /><br />
          <a href="https://raynern.github.io/world-clock-3.2/"
            >3. World Clock</a

        </div>
        <p>
          In this project I practiced React. Main skills that I applied were:
          props, state, effect and generating components as lists. I also tried
          styling the website with React Bootstrap, which was quite useful given
          that I can continue using Bootstrap utilities that I'm slightly
          familiar with. More practice is needed. I would also like to practice
          more event handling and learn how to structure my components better
          throughout my codebase.
