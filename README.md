# Rocket Academy Coding Bootcamp: Portfolio Page

What i learnt: to prevent an element from taking up the full space of the parent div, set it to inline-flex and max-width: fit content

what can be improved:
i was rushing to finish this on time, so css can definitely be refactored to have helper-classes (especially flex-containers)
not
i did not add any hover states and updated the icons to contain links
