          Working in a team of two, I helped program and sprite this game for a
          72-hour game jam (Kenney Game Jam, 2023. Theme: Exploration). Explore
          a map with four regions and fend off enemies along the way!

          Currently in progress, The Winter Trail is heavily inspired by The
          Oregon Trail! Take on the role of a god, and guide your reluctant
          worshippers to safety. What will you sacrifice, to get to Paradise?

          I made this website like 1 month ago when I was learning the basics of
          CSS. I regularly show this to my older students. It's hilarious to see
          their reactions.

          Whack monsters in the face in style with Untitled Tower Escape Gaeme,
          a rhythm based 2D side-scroller mobile game! I discontinued this game
          ages ago because I started making this when I was still learning how
          to code, and it has enough spaghetti code to feed all of Italy.
