          They had always called it the green river. It made sense. The river
          was green. The river likely had a different official name, but to
          everyone in town, it was and had always been the green river. So it
          was with great surprise that on this day the green river was a
          fluorescent pink.

          It wasn't quite yet time to panic. There was still time to salvage the
          situation. At least that is what she was telling himself. The reality
          was that it was time to panic and there wasn't time to salvage the
          situation, but he continued to delude himself into believing there
          was.

          They argue. While the argument seems to be different the truth is it's
          always the same. Yes, the topic may be different or the circumstances,
          but when all said and done, it all came back to the same thing. They
          both knew it, but neither has the courage or strength to address the
          underlying issue. So they continue to argue.

          The river slowly meandered through the open space. It had hidden
          secrets that it didn't want to reveal. It had a well-planned strategy
          to appear calm, inviting, and appealing. That's how the river lured
          her unknowing victims to her water's edge.
