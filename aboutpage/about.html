      <h4>
        I first got hooked on product management when I had the chance to intern
        at Xiaomi China during my undergraduate days. There, I saw how a company
        was built around its products, where product managers played integral
        roles in bringing both business and technical priorities together. I
        knew I wanted to be at the centre of action, diving deep into what makes
        products tick from both business and technical perspectives, and working
        across stakeholders to bring ideas to life, imagine new ways to delight
        customers and be at the forefront of growing businesses. After my first
        product development stint with DBS, I’m now a Product Manager with
        YouTrip, where I manage full-cycle product development for B2C product
        verticals, from user validation and prototyping, to shipping into
        production and the eventual launch. I’m proudest of having spearheaded
        product development in 2 key markets (Singapore and Thailand), achieving
        3x transaction volume increase, projected 2x growth in user base, as
        well as a new authentication system for users in Thailand. It’s been an
        exciting ride, full of growth and learnings, and I won’t have it any
        other way! Outside of work, I’m all about building and developing
        products too. I co-founded SAGE, an online knowledge-sharing platform
        for >500 youths to connect with industry mentors. I’ve also started
        Goodhub SEA, a community for youths to learn & build Tech for Good
        across Southeast Asia I just love building new things and bringing
        visions to life. As good product management requires cross-functional
        knowledge and experience, I’m all about immersing myself and building
        across industries (B2B and B2C), domains (finance, tech and more) and
        borders (Singapore, Southeast Asia and China) so that I can contribute
        effectively. Hit me up if you’re also about building products we love
